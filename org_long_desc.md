Tox is a free and open source replacement to the well used proprietary application Skype.

ToxBlinkenwall is a Project that evolved out of Tox (with Members of the Toktok Organization
being involved in both Tox and ToxBlinkenwall) to bring easy, cheap and opensource
Video Conferencing Software (and Hardware) to People everywhere on the globe.
We are focusing on ease of use, and low cost readily available Hardware and Video optimizations by using
Hardware Acceleration as much as possible (on the Raspberry PI for example).

As we are closely working together with the Tox Community (being a part of it ourselves), and new Features will
be merged upstream back to Tox. and vice versa.
