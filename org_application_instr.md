We are happy that you consider applying as a Student for GSoC 2019 for our Organization.

To Apply it would be good if you have some experience in the Programming Language C and with the Linux Operating System.
If possible you should own (or get) a Raspberry Pi 3B (or 3B+) and a Raspberry Pi Camera module V2.

We will guide you through building a Video Conferencing System in a blink of an eye, it will enable you to
talk to us and also to develop and test any new Code right on that system.

although the above is not mandatory, it will be great fun and make communication so much more natural.
otherwise just apply per Email or join us on our IRC / Matrix Channel.

and don't forget, have fun!
